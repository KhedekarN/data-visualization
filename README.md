# data-visualization
Data visualization is incredibly important for data scientists, as it helps them communicate their insights to nontechnical peers. But you donâ€™t need to be a design pro. Python is a popular, easy-to-use programming language that offers a number of libraries specifically built for data visualization. In this project I have built accurate, engaging, and easy-to-generate charts and graphs using Python. Explored the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, and then discovered how to load and clean data sets and create simple and advanced plots, including heatmaps, histograms, and subplots.
